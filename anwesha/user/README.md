#  User-App

## What is this ‚ùì
This Application contains all the code related to user authenticaton and QR regenration.

### General Instructions on file structure üìÇ
- code for Api are in `views.py` where each class maps to an api endpoint.
- data model of user object in `models.py`
- middleware related code should go in `middle.py`
- admin pannel configurations are in `admin.py`
- all the test should be in `test.py`
- Code must follow DRY principle and all the utlilty functions should go in `utility.py`
- `app.py` is for application specific configurations

### Configuration guidelines ‚öôÔ∏è

- In this application only configuration required is when you want to store your images and QR to AWS S3 , then you need to change QR and profilePitcure field in  `models.py`
- In views.py there is not a feature to switch between S3 qr url and static storage url so  thats needs to be handled manually
- verifyEmail Api in `views.py` has a redirect url that needs to point to your frontend application.
