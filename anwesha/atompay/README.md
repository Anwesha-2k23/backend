# Atompay-Integration-App üí∏

## What is this ‚ùì
This Application contains all the code related to Atompay APIs and data.

### General Instructions on file structure üìÇ
- code for Api are in `views.py` where each class maps to an api endpoint.
- data model of user object in `models.py`
- middleware related code should go in `middle.py`
- admin pannel configurations are in `admin.py`
- all the test should be in `test.py`
- `app.py` is for application specific configurations

### Configuration guidelines ‚öôÔ∏è
- This application interacts with the AtomPay API and processes responses via a secure endpoint.
- For security, encryption is handled using AES encryption for the data sent to AtomPay, and HMAC SHA-512 is used for signature validation.
- Ensure the required AtomPay keys and secrets are configured in the settings for successful communication with AtomPay.
- The system uses JWT tokens for user authentication, so the middleware must be correctly configured to validate user tokens.
